#jQuery Shop

##Steps
- Add jQuery to project
- Add a JS file and make sure it is hooked up
- When a user clicks a 'Buy Item' button
	- Append a new list item to the ```#cart``` that includes the name of the item that is being bought and the price of the item
	- With each new item added to the cart, calculate the total value of items within the cart
	- Include a button on each of the cart items that allows the user to remove an item one by one

##Hints
- You'll need to look into 'DOM Traversal' in the jQuery documentation
- You'll also need to look at using ```$(this)``` when you click on items
