Write the pseudocode for a program for that controls an ATM.

This program will have to handle the different scenarios with:

The Credit Card.
The Keypad.
The Screen.
The Cash dispenser.

Some Examples Cases:

What happens when the card inserted is not a credit/debit card.
What's happening when the ATM cannot provide the amount requested.
What's happening when the amount requested is too big compared to the maximum authorised withdrawal amount.
What's happening when 3 wrong pins have been entered by the card's owner ?
===================


main
	set machineState to 'standby'


// check inserted card
checkCard
	IF cardInserted === 'debit card' || 'credit card'
		DO checkPinNumber
	ELSE
		PRINT 'Please enter a credit card or a debit card'
		DO ejectCard
	ENDIF

// check PIN number
checkPinNumber
	READ card details
	IF


READ name, hourlyRate, hoursWorked
grossPay = hourlyRate * hoursWorked
IF grossPay >= 100
	deduction = grossPay * deductionRate
ELSE
	deduction = 0
ENDIF
netPay = grossPay â€“ deduction
WRITE name, grossPay, deduction, netPay
